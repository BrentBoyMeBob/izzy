# Izzy

Izzy is an ongoing, extendable, and minimal digital assistant powered completely algorithmically, without the need for any artificial intelligence. This means that it will not collect any data, period. This also means that it will not access any external APIs or connections.

It should not be used in a large scale capacity yet as it is very experimental and in-development software.
